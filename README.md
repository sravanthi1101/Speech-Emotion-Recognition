# Speech-Emotion-Recognition

## Speech based Emotion Recogntion model to detect the emotion of the user through their speech input built using two Deep Neural Networks- RNN and MLP, while exploring various properties of Librosa library and implementing user voice recording using Wavio and SoundDevice.

### Dataset
Toronto emotional speech set (TESS) from Kaggle

### Tech Stack
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit Learn
- Librosa
- Wavio
- SoundDevice

### Model Accuracy
- RNN(LSTM) -> 97.02%
- MLP -> 98.5%
Hence, MLP gave higher accuracy
